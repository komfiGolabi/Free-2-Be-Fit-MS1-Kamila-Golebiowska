## Handling Bugs and what is remaining

## Testing

## Deployment

1. Created repository with the title of the page "Free-2-Be-Fit".
2. I worked on my site and in the cdr terminal was adding the changes, then commiting them with the information about the changes, once I was happy with everything I worked with I was pushing it,so it is stored in Git Hub.
3. To make a shareable link of my project, once in the repository, I went into Settings, then in the Git Hub Pages sections in the source window I put master branch and /root file. I saved it and it created the link within the repository.
