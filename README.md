### Icons and Fonts

Font I used was Oswald taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) 

Logo and Icons used free icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/?from=io)

### Code

I used certain parts of code from other sources and modified it for my needs
 * Navbar Menu was taken from Whiskey Drop Project from Code Institute, as it used Bootstrap and a navbar toggler button, then I modified the rest with my own styling in CSS.

 * The inspiration for my page was an example from Bootstrap, where I applied certain parts of it , inluding carousel, 
 testimonial parts, as well as the photos lay out which I used in the services section of my project.
 [Example from Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/carousel/)

 * Carousel was taken from Carousel section of the Bootstrap components and modified.
 [Carousel-Slides Only](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/carousel/)
 * Idea behind the welcome section in homepage and services layout was taken from Bootstrap example mentioned above and modified.
 * Testimonials sections were taken from the above mentioned Bootstrap Example and Whiskey Drop project was checked for the images and modified for my own use.
 * Timetable format was taken from Bootstrap using striped table rows 
 [Striped row Table](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/content/tables/)
 * Booking form was taken from the Bootstrap component section and modified for the project.
 [Form- form control](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/forms/)
* Footer used Bootsrtap Card group, but removed the images from it.
[Bootstrap Card Group](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/card/#header-and-footer)


 I used various sources to help me when I was stuck, including:
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
* [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)
* [W3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)


## Handling Bugs and what is remaining
### My struggles
* I had an issue with the default Bootstrap margin, even though I set margin and padding of the body to 0, used Chrome Dev Tool to find the way to remove it, my making a margin of the row class to -15px.
* issues with original footer, that even though it was enwrapped in Bootstrap columns it wasn't responsive. In result I changed the layout to Bootstrap cards, that sorted this issue out.
* Carousel Images, the height of it wasn't responsive and once the screen was changed it was leaving an empty space between the images and the welcome section. I used a lot of googling and after trying various ways changing height to auto did the work.
* Booking form was spilling into the next div on different devices. After some research,setting box-sizing into border-box made a difference.

* I had some issues with responsivenesss so I used media querys to fix the issues,for example in an 768px screen the navbar wasnt responsive, so I had to change the font size of the links.

 ### Existing Bugs

 * Background photos might sometimes load slower.
 * on some screens between the mobile and I pad the heading on the second carousel caption might not be that clear to see, overlay needed.
 




## Testing

[Check responsiveness](https://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fkomfigolabi.github.io%2FFree-2-Be-Fit%2F)

[HTML Validator Page](https://validator.w3.org/)

* After testing Homepage in direct input, there were no errors or warnings.
* services page had no errors or warnings after putting the code as a direct input into the html validator page.
* Fees and timetable page showed no errors of warnings after putting the code as a direct input into the html validator page.

![image of passed validator page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komfiGolabi/Free-2-Be-Fit/master/assets/images/validator.png)

[CSS Validator Page](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
* Code from style.css was copied as a direct input into the CSS validator page and no errors were found, only one warning, where I put button background color and a border in the same color.

Google Dev Tool: Lighthouse 

 * I made reports for each site on both desktop and mobile options.The score was fluctuating slightly at different points in time. The below photo shows the final raport.  

 ![Lighthouse Desktop](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komfiGolabi/Free-2-Be-Fit/master/assets/images/lighthouse%20raport-desktop.png)

 ![Lighthouse Homepage Mobile](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/komfiGolabi/Free-2-Be-Fit/master/assets/images/lighthouse%20raport-mobile.png)


* Website was tested on various browsers: Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozzila Firefox and on all of those performed well.
 

 ### First Time User:

 * it is clearly stated what is the philosophy of the business in the welcome section of the homepage
 * it was important for me to feel that this business fitness is for everyone, any levels,any background and I totally feel it is. It has been few times mentioned that is inclusive and everyone can find services according to their needs. Testimonials give us perspective from every level of fitness, so it makes it feel trustworthy.
 * Layout is very mellow and positive. It is not aggressive and it makes me think that the approach of the business to fitness is more holistic, approaching its from the lifestyle change side and light hearted place, rather than paying attention only to the physique.
 * There are clearly stated the services it provides, for the future more of the videos of the particular classes would be helpful.
 * page is practical and functional, easy to manouvre
 * It is easy to find a booking page and buttons on the navbar are helpful to do so.

 ### Returning User

* As a regular customer it is important for me to find a timetable easy and that it is clear to see all the schedule. I think the page provides just that.
* The links to social media help to get an easy access to get in touch with business, e-mail is provided, would be nice to have a direct link to it as well.
* Booking system is working well, the only that would help for the future is to have, for every particular class the choice of time and date when they are in schedule, rather than all days and times.

## Deployment

1. Created repository with the title of the page "Free-2-Be-Fit".
2. I worked on my site and in the cdr terminal was adding the changes, then commiting them with the information about the changes, once I was happy with everything I worked with I was pushing it,so it is stored in Git Hub.
3. To make a shareable link of my project, once in the repository, I went into Settings, then in the Git Hub Pages sections in the source window I put master branch and /root file. I saved it and it created the link within the repository.
