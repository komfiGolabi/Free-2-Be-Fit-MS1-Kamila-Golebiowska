### Code

I used certain parts of code from other sources and modified it for my needs
 * Navbar Menu was taken from Whiskey Drop Project from Code Institute, as it used Bootstrap and a navbar toggler button, then I modified the rest with my own styling in CSS.

 * The inspiration for my page was an example from Bootstrap, where I applied certain parts of it , inluding carousel, 
 testimonial parts, as well as the photos lay out which I used in the services section of my project.
 [Example from Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/carousel/)

 * Carousel was taken from Carousel section of the Bootstrap components and modified.
 [Carousel-Slides Only](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/carousel/)
 * Idea behind the welcome section in homepage and services layout was taken from Bootstrap example mentioned above and modified.
 * Testimonials sections were taken from the above mentioned Bootstrap Example and Whiskey Drop project was checked for the images and modified for my own use.
 * Timetable format was taken from Bootstrap using striped table rows

## Handling Bugs and what is remaining

## Testing

## Deployment

1. Created repository with the title of the page "Free-2-Be-Fit".
2. I worked on my site and in the cdr terminal was adding the changes, then commiting them with the information about the changes, once I was happy with everything I worked with I was pushing it,so it is stored in Git Hub.
3. To make a shareable link of my project, once in the repository, I went into Settings, then in the Git Hub Pages sections in the source window I put master branch and /root file. I saved it and it created the link within the repository.
